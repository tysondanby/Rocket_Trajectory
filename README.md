# Rocket_Trajectory
A MATLAB Script that helps the user visualize a rocket flight path. Uses the Ode45() function

Details about the rocket and launch location can be defined by editing Saturn_V.m
Between the markers "PARAMETERS" and "END-PARAMETERS," There are several launch and vehicle parameters that can be edited.

Details about the flight path can be defined by editing "rocketfun.m" between the markers "THINGS YOU CAN CONTROL" and "END THINGS YOU CAN CONTROL"
The default flight path is ascent, gravity turn, and low Earth orbit.


TODO:
Add a config file so the user can use this to set parameters and functions instead of editing code.
